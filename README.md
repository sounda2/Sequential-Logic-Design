# Sequential-Logic-Design

## Project Description

The purpose of this project was to develop a circuit to cycle through a BCD encoding of a unique 9-digit value and display the aforementioned value on a seven-segment display (7DS). To achieve this goal I primarily implemented  JK flip flops as well as AND, OR, and/or NAND logic gates. The project involved several stages of design, optimization, testing, and final implementation.
